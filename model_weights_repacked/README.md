# Ternary-Bonsai-1.7B — Unpacked FP16 Safetensors

FP16 safetensors (HuggingFace format) of the ternary Bonsai-1.7B model. This repo exists for users who want to run Ternary Bonsai with stock HuggingFace tooling or frameworks that don't yet support any of the packed ternary format. The MLX 2-bit format is currently the only packed format available; more formats for other backends are coming soon.

> **We strongly recommend using the natively packed models instead.** The packed format is where all the benefits of Bonsai come from — up to 9x memory reduction, 4x faster inference, and lower energy per token. This unpacked FP16 version is full-size and does not provide any of those advantages.

For the optimized ternary release model (recommended):
